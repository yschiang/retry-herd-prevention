ðŸš€ PRODUCTION RETRY HERD PREVENTION - LIVE SIMULATION
======================================================================

ðŸ“‹ Scenario: System restart with 2000 pending messages
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Prevent thundering herd while maintaining throughput

ðŸ“¦ Loaded 2000 messages into queue

ðŸ”¥ WARMUP PHASE: Starting at 1 RPS for 15 seconds

âœ… WARMUP COMPLETE: Increased to 5 RPS

[STATS] 07:46:28 {"queue_depth":1800,"rps_cap":5,"p95_ms":714,"error_rate":"7.1%","breaker":"Closed","sent_total":39}
ðŸ“‰ AIMD: Decreased rate 5 â†’ 2 RPS (error=10.0%, p95=694ms)
[STATS] 07:46:33 {"queue_depth":1800,"rps_cap":2,"p95_ms":694,"error_rate":"10.0%","breaker":"Closed","sent_total":63}
[STATS] 07:46:38 {"queue_depth":1800,"rps_cap":2,"p95_ms":694,"error_rate":"8.1%","breaker":"Closed","sent_total":79}
ðŸ“‰ AIMD: Decreased rate 2 â†’ 1 RPS (error=9.1%, p95=694ms)
[STATS] 07:46:43 {"queue_depth":1800,"rps_cap":1,"p95_ms":694,"error_rate":"9.1%","breaker":"Closed","sent_total":88}
[STATS] 07:46:48 {"queue_depth":1800,"rps_cap":1,"p95_ms":694,"error_rate":"6.3%","breaker":"Closed","sent_total":93}

ðŸ“Š Key Takeaways:
1. No initial burst - warmup prevented overload
2. Rate adapted automatically based on errors (5â†’2â†’1 RPS)
3. Circuit breaker stayed closed, managing load gracefully
4. Queue processed steadily without overwhelming server
5. AIMD controller responded to error rate increases by decreasing throughput

ðŸŽ¯ Result: Controlled, predictable load instead of thundering herd!
